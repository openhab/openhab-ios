This is the legacy version of the openHAB IOS app. This version is designed for openHAB systems running version 1.x and later as well as IOS version 15 and earlier.  This version of the app will only be updated for security reasons and is considered deprecated.  For a more modern experience we recommend users install our updated IOS application which includes Apple Watch support, more frequent updates as well as new and exciting features. This new IOS app supports openHAB versions 3.x and later.

The open Home Automation Bus (openHAB) project aims at providing a universal integration platform for all things around home automation. It is designed to be absolutely vendor-neutral as well as hardware/protocol-agnostic. openHAB brings together different bus systems, hardware devices and interface protocols.
