This is the native iOS and Apple Watch companion application for openHAB - an open source home automation system. 

The open Home Automation Bus (openHAB) project aims at providing a universal integration platform for connecting home automation technologies into a single intelligent system.  With more than 3000 things that openHAB can connect to, there’s virtually nothing that can’t be integrated. Its advanced rules based architecture allows complete automation using several popular scripting languages (Java Script, Ruby, Python, Java, RDSL, and more ) as well as visual rule designers using either drag and drop interfaces or simple “If / Then” forms. The new openHAB UI allows users to easily build beautiful interfaces customized to their needs.  openHAB is designed to be absolutely vendor-neutral as well as hardware/protocol-agnostic.  

iOS Key Features:

* Integrates seamlessly with your own openHAB UI (Main UI or sitemaps)
* Control everything on your openHAB server directly or remotely through the free openHAB Cloud service (https://myopenhab.org)
* Enhanced push notifications with media from openHAB Cloud and the openHAB cloud binding
* Apple Watch companion app
* Natively supports both iPhone and iPad
